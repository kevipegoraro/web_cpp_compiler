Project: A local web-based C++ code editor that runs entirely on your computer using a C++ backend server. The frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) provides a simple browser interface where users can write C++ code, while the backend server (written in C++) handles compiling and executing that code using `g++`. You’ve also created Bash automation scripts to set up the environment, verify project structure, compile the server, and run it. The system is designed to work locally for now but structured in a way that could later be deployed to a real server with minimal changes.

The next clear steps are: first, implement proper POST request handling in your C++ server so the browser can send code dynamically instead of serving only static HTML. Second, capture both compilation errors and runtime output safely, including adding execution time limits to prevent infinite loops. Third, improve the frontend by integrating a real code editor like CodeMirror for syntax highlighting. Finally, refactor your project structure by separating setup and run scripts, and consider containerizing the app (e.g., Docker) to make deployment to a public server safer and more professional.
